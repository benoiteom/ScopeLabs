## Overview

Welcome to Learnwell, a simple and straightforward website where a user can browse videos uploaded by others, upload their own videos, and comment on videos. They also have the ability to set their username by logging in. The primary goal here was functionality and code cleanliness, given more time I would like to improve on the overall design on the site.

## Clone and run locally

1. First close this repo

2. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd ScopeLabs
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

4. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The website should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
